To play Frogger:
The object of the game is to get your player across the stones without hitting the bugs. If you hit a bug, you will get another chance to move across the stones. Once you have reatched the water, you have won!

To open the game, double click on the index.html file.
Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.

Enjoy!
